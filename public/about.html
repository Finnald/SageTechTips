            </h1>
            <p>
                SageTechTips is an extremely profitable organisation that has many followers from at least <strong>one</strong> place around the globe.<br>
                It began as meme between the staff, but as it spread it gained high acclaim across the nation and the staff quickly began work on this project that they didn't even know what to do with.<br>
                Hoping to squeeze every last cent out of this profitable opportunity, they set their goal of new years day for SageTechTips LIVE and began advertising at the local government institution.<br>
                The project took some dark turns when the main lead of the project, the widely acclaimed influencer "SageD360" decided to leave and was to request that he may not be associated.<br>
                This set the vibe way back and the rest of the staff ended up rebuilding the vibe through officialy changing the theme of SageTechTips to represent the herb sage rather than the person.
